What is IgAnony
IgAnony (short call of Instagram Anonymous) is a free web-based tool that lets you watch people’s Insta stories, posts anonymously. This great function is not provided by the official Instagram application. Everyday, most of us and especially KOLs (famous people) use Instagram to share great moments/photos and sometimes we need to see what other people are up to without letting them knowing. If you are the user that highly values the privacy and wants your own account’s identity 100% hidden while watching people’s IG stories, IgAnony viewer should be the great online story viewer for you.

When you are browsing via IgAnony app, none of your searches or download history is being recorded. Moreover, it is a third-party platform and hence the person whose story you are viewing will not be notified of it. So you are completely anonymous on the tool.
